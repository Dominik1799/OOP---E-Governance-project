Project Name: Easy-Park

Java application for Object oriented programming class. 

Users can register with their name and vehicle, login to their account and buy parking tickets. There is also an admin account that can remove users or add another parking places. 

I was using SQLite for my database and JDBC library for managing this database within my programm. 

The whole project has a front-end made using JavaFX with jFoenix library.
